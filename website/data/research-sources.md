**Source:** DSA Chapter Directory / Arizona Chapter Websites (2024)

---

## Key Organizing Opportunities in LD19

### 1. Economic Populism
- **High poverty (17.7%)** despite massive copper wealth
- Median income 10% below state average
- Corporate extraction (Freeport-McMoRan) without equitable distribution
- **Messaging:** "Workers built this wealth, workers should control it"

### 2. Labor Revival
- Greenlee County's shift from Democratic (union) to Republican (post-union)
- Historic 1983-1986 strike destroyed union power
- Only 3.7% union membership statewide (historic low)
- **Opportunity:** Rebuild rank-and-file organizing in mines, healthcare, education

### 3. Just Transition Framing
- Democrats lost mining workers by appearing anti-mining
- DSA can advocate for workers-first climate policy
- Green New Deal with job guarantees for miners
- Address water scarcity (Arizona crisis) while protecting mining jobs

### 4. Company Town Organizing
- Morenci: Corporate control over housing, services, amenities
- Tenants have limited power against corporate landlord
- **Strategy:** Tenant organizing, housing justice campaigns

### 5. Healthcare Access
- Rural healthcare deserts
- High poverty but no Medicaid expansion organizing
- Medicare for All resonates with material conditions

### 6. Right-to-Work Repeal
- 2024 ballot initiative failed, but issue remains
- Build grassroots support for future repeal efforts
- Connect to national PRO Act campaign

## Strategic Analysis

### Challenges
1. **R+20-30 district** - overwhelming Republican voter registration
2. **Corporate dominance** - Freeport-McMoRan controls economy and politics
3. **Union decline** - from most Democratic county to most Republican
4. **Geographic dispersion** - rural, spread-out population
5. **Cultural barriers** - "socialist" label in conservative area

### Advantages
1. **Economic anxiety** - high poverty creates receptivity to class-based politics
2. **Corporate antagonist** - clear villain in Freeport-McMoRan
3. **Historic union culture** - can reactivate dormant solidarity
4. **Material issues** - wages, healthcare, housing transcend party
5. **Young demographics** - median age 35, potential for generational shift

### Recommended Strategies
1. **Focus on material conditions** over ideological labels
2. **Worker-centered messaging** that doesn't alienate mining employees
3. **Build coalitions** across party lines on economic issues
4. **Patient organizing** - this is multi-year project
5. **Digital + physical** presence given geographic challenges
6. **Support existing struggles** - strike solidarity, tenant organizing
7. **Political education** - teach class analysis and organizing skills
8. **Run working-class candidates** for school board → city council → state leg
